Time Spent: 30 minutes (+ 10-ish hours before Highway)

**6/4/25** (30 minutes)
I found my previously abandoned Hackpad files and started the tedious process of trying to get the files up to Hackpad submission specifications. I'd previously started this project in October, but never finished the project due to firmware frustrations. The PCB and case were already mostly finished before Highway.
